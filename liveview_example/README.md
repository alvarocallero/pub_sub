# LiveView Example
This is a LiveView app that showcases the ability to send messages through Phoenix.PubSub between a LiveComponent and a LiveView page.

To run this app, follow these steps:

  * Run `mix setup` to get deps, install assets, run migrations, etc
  * Run `iex -S mix phx.server` to start the app
  * Open 2 or more browser tabs at [`localhost:4000/cars`](http://localhost:4000/cars)
  * Add, delete, or sell your cars, and see in real-time the updates in the different tabs!
